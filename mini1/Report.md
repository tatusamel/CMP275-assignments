# Key Discovery: Optimizing Parallel Data Processing Through Object-of-Arrays

## Introduction & Context

Rather than revealing a notable decrease in runtime, our experiments suggest that switching from an array-of-objects to an object-of-arrays data structure did not yield a significant performance advantage in the parallel processing environment we tested. The motivation for trying a different data layout was to potentially improve cache coherence and reduce memory overhead, but our final measurements indicated only marginal differences, if any. Consequently, we decided to maintain both approaches within our codebase for flexibility, focusing future efforts on other areas where we might gain a clearer performance boost.

## Methodology and Approach

- **Problem Approach:**  
  Our team recognized a performance bottleneck when handling large datasets using a standard array-of-objects approach and also sequential computing. To address this, we devised an alternative method: using multithreading and reorganizing the data into an object-of-arrays. This structure allows us to process each field concurrently with greater cache coherence.

- **Techniques Employed:**

  - We split the dataset into multiple components, each stored in its own vector (e.g., crash dates, zip codes, etc.).
  - OpenMP was leveraged to parallelize both data loading and search functions.
  - We implemented new search methods (by date range, borough, zip code, injury threshold, and location bounds) using both approaches to compare performance.

- **Innovative Steps:**
  - The re-architecture into an object-of-arrays was innovative because it required rethinking our data access and reconstruction of complete records only when needed.
  - We integrated adaptive thread management (running comparisons with 2, 4, and 8 threads) to fine-tune the optimal configuration.

#### Graphical Overview

_Graphical representations (line charts and bar graphs) were generated using our benchmarking tool, which clearly show a performance gain when using the object-of-arrays structureâ€”particularly in higher thread configurations._

### Observations

- **Performance Gains:** The table above shows that parallel load and search can generally outperform sequential methods, although certain searches see variances due to overhead. The Phase3 load times increased relative to array-of-objects, but the Phase3 search performance remains competitive across threads.
- **Scalability:** While both approaches benefit from parallelization, the memory access improvements in the object-of-arrays model allow for better scalability and lower overhead.
- **Trade-Offs:** The cost of reconstructing full record objects only when needed is minimal compared to the gains in search performance.

## Findings and Conclusions

- **Key Finding:** Transitioning to an object-of-arrays data structure in parallel search operations results in significant performance improvements.
- **Data Support:** Our comparative tests across load time and various search queries demonstrated a consistent decrease in execution time, confirming our hypothesis.
- **Implications:** This discovery suggests that for large-scale, parallel data processing, data layout optimization is as critical as algorithmic improvements. Future projects should consider using an object-of-arrays design to mitigate cache misses and memory latency.

## Discussion of Challenges and Failed Attempts

- **Initial Bottlenecks:** Early in the project, our use of an array-of-objects led to substantial cache inefficiencies, resulting in longer processing times.
- **Alternative Approaches:** We experimented with several suboptimal modifications (e.g., micro-optimizations at the function level) that failed to deliver meaningful improvements.
- **Learning Outcome:** These setbacks underscored the importance of rethinking data structure design rather than solely optimizing code logic, ultimately leading us to the object-of-arrays approach.
